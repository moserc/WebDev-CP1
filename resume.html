        <dd>Simple, text-based role-playing game that started as a tool for learning Python, then morphed 
          into a four-person web app project. This experience taught me about working on Agile teams, was

          I had the opportunity to lead a skill-share demonstration on simple web browser automation with 
          Selenium. For this project, I worked with the following tools:
          <ul>
