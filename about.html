      <h1>A Little About Me | <a href="resume.html">My Resume</a></h1>
      <p>I'm a computer science student in the Bachelor of Science program at North Seattle College. 
        This will be my second bachelor's degree, as well as an exciting career change to technology. 
        My first career was in massage therapy as an injury treatment specialist. 
        From there I decided that I wanted to get a college degree. I began undergrad studies 
        at Seattle Colleges with a focus on pre-engineering, advanced mathematics, and biology. 
        I then transferred to the University of Washington, where I received my first degree (Evolutionary 
        Biology, '16).
